I'm a game developer with more than 5 years of working experiences in developing games, specialized in **Unity**, **Cocos Creator**, **C#** and **Typescript**.

I study at **Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TAR UMT)** and have a **Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) in Interactive Software Technology**. 
<br/>This course teaches us on designing and developing various type of softwares such as games, mobile apps, AR apps and web sites, with more focus on games.

I spent my free time designing and developing games, and enjoys a lot on designing and developing complex systems that are modular and easy to scale.
